# The LanguageTool server is automatically started by socket activation to save system ressources if it is not needed.
# Unfortunately, it takes some time to start up and LibreOffice has a timeout of only 10 seconds when talking to the
# LanguageTool server, see:
# https://forum.languagetool.org/t/lt-premium-libreoffice-does-not-work/10732/17
# https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/master/lingucomponent/source/spellcheck/languagetool/languagetoolimp.cxx#L148
# This leads to an ugly error message when we start typing the first letters in any LibreOffice document.
#
# Therefore, we kickstart the socket activation here with a simple curl command before starting LibreOffice itself
# and hope that this gives the LanguageTool a long enough head start so that we no longer run into the timeout
# in LibreOffice.
