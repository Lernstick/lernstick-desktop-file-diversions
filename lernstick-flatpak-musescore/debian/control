Description: Changes the menu entry of Musescore
 We remove "Music" from the Categories. Otherwise it also ends up in the Music
 education category where we don't want to have it.
 We also change the name from "MuseScore X.Y" to just "MuseScore" as we think
 that version information doesn't belong into the application name.
