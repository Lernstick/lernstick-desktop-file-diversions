Description: Removes the LibreOffice Writer menu entry
 We remove the LibreOffice Writer menu entry because we already have
 the LibreOffice menu entry for the whole office suite.
 We also enforce the GNOME user interface because the file dialog in the KDE
 user interface currently just sucks.
 See https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=752230 for details.
